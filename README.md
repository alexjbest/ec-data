# Elliptic curves with good reduction outside {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}

### Contents

 - A table of rational elliptic curves (up to Q-isomorphism) with good reduction outside the first 6 primes. 
   Each curve is given as a tuple (c4, c6), such that a Weierstrass model can be recovered as y^2 = x^3 - 27 c4 x - 54 c6.
 - Mordell-Weil bases of Mordell curves that were used to compute the table.
 - Code for computing the Mordel-Weil bases.
 - The [paper](https://github.com/elliptic-curve-data/ec-data-S6/blob/master/docs/paper.pdf) corresponding to this table. 
 
### Completeness of the table

The table is likely to be complete, however this is not proved yet.
Proving completeness with our method should take about 50 more CPU years.

### Authors

Alex J. Best, Benjamin Matschke.

### Contributions

Edgar Costa: 
 - Analytic ranks and leading term of L-functions at 1/2 for all curves in the table.
