	abstract = {In the late 1980s, Brumer and McGuinness [2] undertook the construction of a database of elliptic curves whose absolute discriminant {\textbar}Δ{\textbar} was both prime and satisfied {\textbar}Δ{\textbar} ≤ 108. While the restriction to primality was nice for many reasons, there are still many curves of interest lacking this property. As ten years have passed since the original experiment, we decided to undertake an extension of it, simultaneously extending the range for the type of curves they considered, and also including curves with composite discriminant. Our database can be crudely described as being the curves with {\textbar}Δ{\textbar} ≤ 1012 which either have conductor smaller than 108 or have prime conductor less than 1010—but there are a few caveats concerning issues like quadratic twists and isogenous curves. For each curve in our database, we have undertaken to compute various invariants (as did Brumer and McGuinness), such as the Birch—Swinnerton-Dyer L-ratio, generators, and the modular degree. We did not compute the latter two of these for every curve. The database currently contains about 44 million curves; the end goal is find as many curves with conductor less than 108 as possible, and we comment below on this direction of growth of the database. Of these 44 million curves, we have started a first stage of processing (computation of analytic rank data), with point searching to be carried out in a later second stage of computation.},

    url = {https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387499222},    abstract = {The central theme of this graduate-level number theory textbook is the solution of Diophantine equations, i.e., equations or systems of polynomial equations which must be solved in integers, rational numbers or more generally in algebraic numbers. This theme, in particular, is the central motivation for the modern theory of arithmetic algebraic geometry. In this text, this is considered through three aspects. The first is the local aspect: one can do analysis in p-adic fields, and here the author starts by looking at solutions in finite fields, then proceeds to lift these solutions to local solutions using Hensel lifting. The second is the global aspect: the use of number fields, and in particular of class groups and unit groups. This classical subject is here illustrated through a wide range of examples. The third aspect deals with specific classes of equations, and in particular the general and Diophantine study of elliptic curves, including 2 and 3-descent and the Heegner point method. These subjects form the first two parts, forming Volume I. The study of Bernoulli numbers, the gamma function, and zeta and L-functions, and of p-adic analogues is treated at length in the third part of the book, including many interesting and original applications. Much more sophisticated techniques have been brought to bear on the subject of Diophantine equations, and for this reason, the author has included five chapters on these techniques forming the fourth part, which together with the third part forms Volume II. These chapters were written by Yann Bugeaud, Guillaume Hanrot, Maurice Mignotte, Sylvain Duquesne, Samir Siksek, and the author, and contain material on the use of Galois representations, points on higher-genus curves, the superfermat equation, Mihailescu's proof of Catalan's Conjecture, and applications of linear forms in logarithms. The book contains 530 exercises of varying difficulty from immediate consequences of the main text to research problems, and contain many important additional results.},
